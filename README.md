# Forecasting Electricity Prices using ARIMA Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast electricity prices using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Electricity price forecasting is crucial as it directly impacts the decision-making process of energy companies, helping them optimize resource allocation, pricing strategies, and risk management.

## Why ARIMA?
The ARIMA model is widely used in time series forecasting due to its ability to capture trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical data. The model consists of three main components:

- **Autoregression (AR):** Uses past values to predict future values.
- **Differencing (I):** Makes the time series stationary by removing trends.
- **Moving Average (MA):** Models the relationship between past forecast errors and future values.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical electricity price data, including:

- Date and Time
- Electricity Price per Unit
- Demand and Supply Information (if available)
- External Factors (e.g., temperature, fuel costs, regulatory policies)

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Load the historical electricity price dataset.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Convert data into a time series format.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize electricity price trends.
- Check for seasonality and stationarity.
- Perform statistical tests (ADF Test) to confirm stationarity.

### 3. ARIMA Model Selection
- Determine the order of ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) using ACF and PACF plots.
- Train the ARIMA model using historical data.
- Optimize parameters using grid search or other tuning methods.

### 4. Model Evaluation & Forecasting
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- Generate forecasts for future electricity prices.
- Visualize actual vs. predicted prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
- ARIMA Model (implemented using the statsmodels library)

## How to Run the Project

## Results & Insights
- The trained ARIMA model provides accurate forecasts for short-term electricity prices.
- The model helps in understanding price fluctuations due to demand and external factors.
- Insights from the forecast can assist energy companies in optimizing their strategies.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating deep learning models (LSTM, Prophet) for improved accuracy.
- Incorporating additional external variables (weather, fuel prices) for better predictions.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time forecasting.
